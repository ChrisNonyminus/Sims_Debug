Here is the HP STL, which I could only find from CINT's source code archives.
Below is the original notice from CINT.

// NOTE: it seems to be HEAVILY modified, as it does some things MSVC 6 does not support.

stl/README.txt

 This directory contains modified STL HP reference implementation. 
 Cint is not quite ready for supporting STL.
